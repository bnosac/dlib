# dlib: allowing R users to work with dlib through Rcpp

[Dlib](http://dlib.net) is a C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and computer vision tools. It is used in a wide range of domains including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing environments. This package allows R users to use dlib through the Rcpp package.

The version of dlib which is included is version 19.9.
Some pragma statements in the dlib code are commented out for CRAN compliance.

## Installation

Install from CRAN

```
install.packages("dlib")
```

Install this development version from github with `remotes::install_github("bnosac/dlib")`

## Example

An example of the usage of the package is included regarding identifying SURF descriptors in an image.

```
## See an example of the usage 
help("dlib-package")
```

## Include dlib inside an Rcpp package

The following shows how to include dlib inside an R package which uses Rcpp. Examples on using Rcpp in that way can be found at the [Rcpp gallery](http://gallery.rcpp.org), e.g. http://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/using-boost-with-bh.

```
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::plugins(cpp11)]]
// [[Rcpp::depends(dlib)]]
#include <dlib/algs.h>
#include <dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h>
```

An example of this can be found at the **image.dlib** R package where it is used for image recognition. More information: https://github.com/bnosac/image.dlib.
