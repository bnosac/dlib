##
## Example adapted from http://dlib.net/fhog_ex.cpp.html
## Find the FHOG features of an image

## 
## Step 1: 
## Register a function called dlib_surf to read and extract the FHOG features 
## have a look at the file for how it is structured
f <- system.file("extdata", "rcpp_surf.cpp", package = "dlib")
cat(f, sep = "\\n")
sourceCpp(f)

## 
## Step 2: 
## Convert image from jpeg to BMP3 format as ine dlib_surf, we assume the file is in BMP3 format 
library(magick)
f <- system.file("extdata", "cruise_boat.jpeg", package = "dlib")
img <- image_read(path = f)
img 
f_bmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".bmp")
image_write(img, path = f_bmp, format = "BMP3")

## 
## Step 3: 
## Apply the function Rcpp function dlib_surf on the image
dlib_surf(f_bmp)
}
